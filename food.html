If you should have time and energy, some additional ideas (this is completely optional):
Use an HTML tag (or two!) that are not introduced in Colt’s course
Use a table

            <li>100 g Flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp Baking Soda</li>
            <li>A pinch of Salt</li>

        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the banana, place in a bowl and mash with a fork until mashed.</li>
            <li>Mix the flour, baking powder, sugar and
                salt
                in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the plant-based milk and banana puree and mix to form a thick batter. Leave the
                dough to rest
                for
                approx. 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat some vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and fry the
                pancakes
                one after the other. As soon as small bubbles form, turn the pancakes over so that they are golden brown
                on

                sides.</li>
